# Media Placeholder

Upload official media assets (audio, PDFs, slides, transcripts, brand files) into the subdirectories below before deploying to production:

- `audio/` – MP3, M4A mirrors for China accessibility
- `resources/` – Study guides, slides, handouts
- `transcripts/` – PDF or TXT transcripts supporting accessibility
- `brand/` – Official logo exports
- `galleries/` – HTML galleries or static images for past events

Links throughout the site reference these paths. Replace the placeholder files with real assets during content entry.
